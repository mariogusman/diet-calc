# Daily Calorie Calculator

This project is a simple and straight to the point Calculator that will assist users in finding out how many calories they should be ingesting daily in order to maintain, gain or lose weight.

It was built using JavaScript, Bootstrap and a few lines of CSS.

## UX

This website was designed with simplicity in mind. A very straight forward approach that allows users to get their results in just a few seconds.
Any person who's interested in knowing how many calories to ingest will benefit from this calculator. 
The website also contains an FAQ section with valuable information about how the formulas work.

The layout was always meant to be simple and free of distractions. The image below illustrates the initial concept that was easily achieved using Bootstrap's components:

### User Story #1:
- I'm John, a 30 years old man trying to improve my general eating habits in order to lose weight.
- A friend recommended that I start counting calories and I came to this website to find out how many calories should I be eating.
- After completing the form I became aware that I was eating a bit more than recommended and that I should lower my daily intake to 2036 kcals in order to lose weight.
- I also checked the FAQ and learned a bit about the formulas and that if I do as advised I might lose up to half kilo every week!

### User Story #2:
- My name is Mary, a 24 years old female amateur athlete.
- I have good nutrition knowledge and am already counting calories as part of my training regimen.
- To always keep on track, I come back to this website every week to re-calculate my TDEE and keep progressing.
- I like this website because it is clutter free and easy to navigate on mobile!

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- The main feature is the TDEE Calculator: User fills the Personal Details form and can see the Results after submitting it.
- The Results box is only available after submitting the form and will be cleared upon resetting the form to avoid confusion.
- The second feature is the FAQ which helps users understands terminology and how the formulas work.

### Features Left to Implement
- Integration with an API such as [myfitnesspal](https://myfitnesspalapi.com/) or [EDAMAM](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api) to let users see Nutritional Facts about their favorite foods.
- A toggler to change between Metric and Imperial units, though the formula uses metric units, some users might prefer imperial.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
